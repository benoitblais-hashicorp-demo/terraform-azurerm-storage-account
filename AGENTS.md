# AGENTS.md for Terraform Project

This file provides instructions for AI coding agents working on this Terraform project.

## Project Overview

This project manages Azure ressources using Terraform.

## Module and Repository Structure

Organize your Terraform modules and repositories as follows:

```
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── main.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── providers.tf
├── README.md
├── variables.tf
├── versions.tf
├── ...
├── docs/

│   ├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
│   ├── README_footer.md
│   ├── README_header.md
│   ├── SECURITY
```

### Required Files and Directories
- `main.tf` – Primary resource and data source definitions. Must exist in every module, even if empty.
- `outputs.tf` – Output value definitions (alphabetical order). Must exist in every module, even if empty.
- `providers.tf` – Provider configurations and requirements.
- `README.md` – Required in the root module. Generated using Terraform-Docs.
- `variables.tf` – Input variable definitions (alphabetical order with required at the top). Must exist in every module, even if empty.
- `versions.tf` - Terraform version and provider requirements.
- `docs/README_footer.md` - Provide link to external documentation used to generate the code.
- `docs/README_header.md` - Describe the purpose of the code.

## Tools and Frameworks
- Use `terraform fmt` before every commit to ensure consistent formatting
- Run `terraform fmt -recursive` to format all subdirectories
- Use TFLint for additional static code analysis and organization-specific rules
- USe markdown-lint for additional analysis and organization-specific rules
- Use Terraform-Docs to generate README.md file using the configuration file `./github/terraform-docs/.tfdocs-config.yml`.

## Code Formatting
- Indent two spaces for each nesting level
- Align equals signs when multiple single-line arguments appear consecutively
- Place arguments at the top of blocks, followed by nested blocks with one blank line separation
- Put meta-arguments (count, for_each) first, followed by other arguments, then nested blocks
- Place lifecycle blocks last, separated by blank lines
- Separate top-level blocks with one blank line

## Resource Organization
- Define data sources before the resources that reference them to build logically
- Group related resources together (networking, compute, storage)
- Order resource parameters consistently: meta-arguments, resource-specific parameters, nested blocks, lifecycle, depends_on

## Resource Naming
- Use descriptive nouns separated by underscores
- Do not include the resource type in the resource name
- Wrap resource type and name in double quotes
- Example: `resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {}` not `resource "aws_instance" "webserver_instance" {}`

## Variables and Outputs
- Define `type` and `description` for every variable
- Include reasonable `default` values for optional variables
- Set `sensitive = true` for passwords and private keys
- Order variable parameters: type, description, default, sensitive, validation blocks
- Order output parameters: description, value, sensitive
- Use descriptive names with underscores to separate words

## Comments and Documentation
- Use `#` for single and multi-line comments (not `//` or `/* */`)
- Write self-documenting code; use comments only to clarify complexity
- Add comments above resource blocks to explain non-obvious business logic

## README_header.md
- Describe the general purpose of the code
- A `Permissions` section containing the permissions required to provision resources for each provider
- An `Authentications` section containing the authentication details required for each provider 
- A `Features` section containing key features managed by the code

## Local Values
- Use local values sparingly to avoid making code harder to understand
- Define at the top of a file if specific to that file only
- Use descriptive nouns with underscores for local value names

## Dynamic Resource Management
- Use `count` for nearly identical resources
- Use `for_each` when resources need distinct values that cannot be derived from integers
- Use `count` with conditional expressions for optional resources: `count = var.enable_feature ? 1 : 0`
- Use meta-arguments sparingly and add comments whenever applicable

## Provider Configuration
- Always include a default provider configuration
- Define all providers in the same file (`providers.tf`)
- Define the default provider first, then aliased providers
- Use `alias` as the first parameter in non-default provider blocks

## Version Management
- Pin Terraform version using `required_version` in terraform block
- Pin provider versions using exact versions in `required_providers`
- Pin module versions when sourcing from registries
- Example: `version = "5.34.0"` not `version = "~> 5.0"`

### Version Constraint Best Practices
- Use the minimal version constraint necessary to ensure compatibility; avoid overly broad or overly restrictive constraints.
- Prefer the pessimistic constraint operator (`~>`) for modules and providers to allow safe updates within a compatible version range.
- Avoid using only the equals (`=`) operator unless you must lock to a single version for reproducibility or known issues.
- Document the rationale for version constraints in code comments, especially if using strict or unusual constraints.
- Regularly review and update version constraints to keep dependencies current and secure.
- Avoid open-ended constraints (e.g., `>`, `>=` without an upper bound) in production code, as this can lead to unexpected breaking changes.
- Test your configuration with the allowed version range to ensure compatibility.

## Security and Secrets
- Never commit `terraform.tfstate` files or `.terraform` directories
- Use dynamic provider credentials when possible
- Access secrets from external secret management systems
- Set `sensitive = true` for sensitive variables
- Use environment variables for provider credentials

## Testing and Validation
- Use variable validation blocks for restrictive requirements
- Include input validation with meaningful error messages

## State Management
- Use HCP Terraform remote state storage
- Use `tfe_outputs` data source for sharing data between workspaces
- Use provider-specific data sources instead of sharing full state files
- Separate environments into different workspaces or directories

## Error Handling
- Include meaningful descriptions for all variables and outputs
- Use validation blocks with clear error messages
- Structure code to fail fast with descriptive errors
- Validate input parameters before resource creation
